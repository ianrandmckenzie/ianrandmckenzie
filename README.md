## Most repositories are private.

If you are a prospective client/employer, I recommend against using this profile as a reflection of my ability/experience/portfolio. To see what I've been up to, check out my [resum√©](https://ianrandmckenzie.com/resume) and [portfolio](https://objektiv.digital/portfolio).

Recruiters: Please note I am only available for part-time work due to my dissability (schizophrenia).
