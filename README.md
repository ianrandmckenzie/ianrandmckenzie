# Ian Rand McKenzie - GitHub

## Recruiters

Please note I am only available for part-time work due to my disability ([schizophrenia](https://ianrandmckenzie.com/blog/)).

Outside of one of my projects turning into a success (aka paying my bills + adding to retirement fund), my dream job would be to create/maintain open source Ruby/Rails libraries in a part-time (20hrs/wk) commitment.

## Most repositories are private.

If you are a prospective client/employer, I recommend against using this profile as a reflection of my ability/experience/portfolio as it relates to code quality or production output per hour. To see what I've been up to, check out my [resumÃ©](https://ianrandmckenzie.com/resume) and [portfolio](https://objektiv.digital/portfolio).

## Active Coding Projects
* [Objektiv Digital](https://objektiv.digital) â€“ We make websites for successful local businesses.
* [Enderbook](https://enderbook.com) - The social app for Minecrafters.
* [Meet with the Company](https://meetwiththe.company) - A cheap, white label alternative to Calendly.com that I built one weekend after feeling like I was getting nickel'd and dimed by all the SaaS I was subscribing to at the beginning of starting my sole proprietorship.
* [The Meme Hotline](tel:+18334691337) - A toll free line to listen to robot-voice dad jokes and get text messages with memes posted on Reddit. 1-833-469-1337
