## Recruiters

Please note I am only available for part-time work due to my disability ([schizophrenia](https://ianrandmckenzie.com/blog/)).

Outside of one of my projects turning into a success (aka paying my bills + adding to retirement fund), my dream job would be to create/maintain open source Ruby/Rails libraries in a part-time (20hrs/wk) commitment. Otherwise, a Ruby/Rails project in a technology stack that I already use a business or consumer would be pretty exciting.

## Most repositories are private.

If you are a prospective client/employer, I recommend against using this profile as a reflection of my ability/experience/portfolio as it relates to code quality or production output per hour. To see what I've been up to, check out my [resumé](https://ianrandmckenzie.com/resume) and [portfolio](https://objektiv.digital/portfolio).
